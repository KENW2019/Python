i am dapei.
now, I am working on BJEV project and responsible for CAN and diagnostic domain include can com, diag dcm ,diag dem and some swc.
and I am also responsible for the CANApplication SWC that be used to forward CAN message to SOC side by Ipc.
Actually,I think that the technicality of these modules is not very complex, but the workload is very huge, so a new guys shanyou joined us last week.
